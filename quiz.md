## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1.	Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
-	Software components can be made reusable through service interfaces, according to SOA (service-oriented architecture). These interfaces make use of widely accepted communication standards, making it possible to quickly integrate them into new applications without requiring thorough integration each time.
A design pattern called service-oriented architecture, or SOA, is intended to be used in the construction of distributed systems that provide services to other applications via a protocol. It is merely an idea, not specific to any platform or language of programming.
2.	List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Service Loose coupling: This indicates a low level of dependency on the service. similar to services that are independent of one another. Thus, the client application shouldn't malfunction or cease to function if the functionality of the service changes.
- Service reusability: The same services can be applied repeatedly. After the service's code is written, it ought to be compatible with a number of applications.
- Service Statelessness: This means that there is no data maintained or stored about the services.
-Service discoverability: As a service provider, we are responsible for any services we develop. It needs to be uploaded to the service registry, and once it is, we need to apply to IIPA. It becomes discoverable after they verify the service registry.
- Service Abstraction: Keeping data from other services hidden. The way the service performs its functionalities shouldn't be made public.

3.	Define Microservices.
-	Although its target market is small businesses and organizations rather than large corporations, microservices offer similar features to service-oriented architecture, such as being reusable and a collection of services. Microservices also offer a much more agile, scalable, and resilient service for individual application uses.

4.	List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-	The benefit of using microservices is their deployability they can be deployed with fewer efforts compared to a much larger scaled service that takes time to implement small changes, it is also beneficial to employees since with a small code they can understand it much easier and faster requiring a little effort, aside from that microservices is highly modifiable and can be sculpted to a specific use, not only that microservice also offer cloud-based services which make data to be accessible anywhere.

5.	List and discuss the similarities and differences between SOA and Microservices.
-	Both Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices offer the same thing they both offer a much easier and more reliable function to an organization with their reusability, scaling, and compatibility features it feels a requirement to have one since it enables efficient use of resources and time, and their only difference is the target appropriateness in use Service Oriented Architecture will prove best for large-scale enterprises that have a lot of resources in terms of manpower and margin as for the Microservices as the name suggests it is for a much smaller organization with fewer resource however due to its size it is proven to be more agile, and easy to handle with it being modified to a specific use.

6.	Define Web Services.
-	Web services is a piece of software that is made available in the internet. Web service is a collection of open protocol and standards used in exchanging data between applications, and can be used in different platforms to exchange data for example the internet.

7.	List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
-	Exposing the Existing Function on the network - The web services code can be viewed by users revealing its functionality over the internet
-	Interoperability - Allows web services to talk to other web services which they can share analytics, data and services
-	Standardized Protocol - The web service uses the standardized protocol which allows business owner or owners in general to be versatile, reduce cost due to competitions, and being standarized increase in quality
-	Low Cost Communication - The web service uses SOAP instead of HTTP protocol, which allows them to use low cost internet for implementing there services and can also be implemented in other reliable transport mechanisms 

8.	List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
-	XML-Based - Web services uses XML which eliminates networking bindings, and allows web services based application to be highly interoperable

-	Loosely Coupled - Allows web services to be updated and changed without limiting or restricting the accessibility of a user, which is the client side and server logic are loosely tied which allows this process
-	Coarse-Grained - holds a bundle of related data which provide a broaded functionalities which is why it is commonly used in a corporate level it also grant a good amount of business logic  for access
-	Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous - Allows client synchronicity which tied them to a specific service unable to perform other things, while in asynchronicity clients can use a service while simultaneously can access other services, and they bussiness can set mode between them.
-	Support Remote Procedure Call - Allows client to invoke different things on the web service like procedures, functions, and methods on remote object by using XML-based protocols
-	Supports Document Exchange - XML has a clever way of showing or representing data to simple to complex ones. Since it supports an transparent exchange of documents to facilitates  

9.	List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
-	Provider - The one who creates the web service to be made available for those clients who wants it
-	Requestor - The client who contacts the web service to look for the web service functionality
-	Broker - The one who provide access to the UDDI, The UDDi enables the client application to locate and access the web service.

10.	List and discuss the Web Services Components.
-	SOAP (Simple Obeject Access Protocol)- is an XML-based protocol that allows the exchange of information between computers, it also communicates communication protocol between applications
-	WSDL (Web Services Description Languages) -  an XML- based language which is in charge for describing the web service and a way on how it can be accessed, it is also an integral part of UDDI that facilitates businesses to be listed in the internet
-	UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) - an XML-based standard in charge of describing, publishing, and finding web services, it is an open framework and platform independent and seen as one of the three foundation standards of web services besides SOAP and WSDL
